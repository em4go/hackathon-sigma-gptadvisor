# Coding guidelines

## DO's 

- Use bun as the runtime environment for all JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- Always use responsive design principles when creating user interfaces. The web app will be mostly used on mobile devices, so ensure that the UI adapts well to different screen sizes.
- Use shadcn and ai-elements for UI components to maintain a consistent and modern design across the application. Use the ai-elements and shadcn-ui skills to follow best practices when implementing these components.
- Use better-icons for icons to ensure a visually appealing and cohesive user interface. Use the better-icons skill to find and implement appropriate icons throughout the application.
